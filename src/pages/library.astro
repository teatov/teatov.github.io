    <p>Welcome to my huge ass list of all the music that I have.</p>
    <p>
      I believe that the best way to listen to music is to have it on your hard
      drive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also I really, really like sharing stuff that I like, so here's a full
      tree view of my <code>Music</code> directory.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-1">
      I've been gathering music for my whole life, so there's A LOT.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it's not really convenient as a recommendation playlist. <br />
      But you can still try looking up anything that may pick your interest.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-1">
      I wish I could provide links for all of it, but it would be an insane task
      since there's so much entries, <br />
      but I'll try my best to at least add links and info for the more obscure stuff.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-1">
      You can use this to check if my tastes intersect with yours, if that
      matters to you.<br />
      But something being present here doesn't guarantee I actually enjoy it or even
      have ever touched it, <br /> I might just like the music.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-1">
      All the tracks are divided into 5 categories. The names are pretty
      self-explanatory,<br />
      but <code>mashups</code> can mean any sort of remixes and also include SiIvaGunner,<br
      />
      and <code>youtube music</code> includes anything I specifically found on YouTube
      or strongly associate with it.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-1">
      Directories with names starting with <code>_</code> are groups. <br />
      They are pretty arbitrary, be it by franchise, studio, artist or just vibes.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-1">
      <strong
        >Tip: you can middle-click on the links to open them in a new tab.</strong
      > It makes opening lots of links faster.
